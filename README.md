# Docs

In the `docs` folder can be found the following markdown documents:

- PotentialQuestions
  - Assumptions tracked which were made during the coding process and the logic behind the assumption.
  - Potential questions that might be good for an interview.
- Tasks
  - A list of what items were done for the project and in what order. Kind of a changelog.
- Prioritization
  - An ordered list of what was prioritized as this assignment was being completed.

# Setup

1. Install node modules
2. iOS setup

- cd ios && pod install
- You might have to set up a signing team in XCode
- If you have to open it, heads up that the project was originally called `sleepy` -> ./ios/sleepy.xcworkspace (When I tested with a fresh clone, it wouldn't run from the terminal via `npm run ios` but would start up fine when ran from XCode)

# Testing

Tests and coverage are set up on the repo. Coverage is sitting around 60%

## Heads up

There's a few different touch interactions available for the graphs. I ran it on an iPad mini and it looks fine, but hasn't been optimized for this yet.
